Two words are synonyms if they have very similar meanings. Synonyms represent the same type or category of thing. Here are some examples of synonym pairs: 

- cup/mug
- glasses/spectacles
- envy/jealousy

In practice, word pairs that are not exactly synonymous may still be very similar. Here are some very similar pairs - we could say they are nearly synonyms:

- alligator/crocodile
- love/affection
- frog/toad

In contrast, although the following word pairs are related, they are not very similar. The words represent entirely different types of things:

- car/tire
- car/motorway
- car/crash

In this survey, you are asked to compare word pairs and to rate how similar they are, on a scale from 0 (not at all similar) to 10 (the same concept). Remember, things that are related are not necessarily similar.

If you are ever unsure, think back to the examples of synonymous pairs (glasses/spectacles), and consider how close the words are (or are not) to being synonymous.

There is no right answer to these questions. It is perfectly reasonable to use your intuition or gut feeling as a native English speaker, especially when you are asked to rate word pairs that you think are not similar at all.
