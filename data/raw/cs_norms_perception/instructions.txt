Welcome to the experiment!

In this study, you will read a series of sentences, each containing a target word. 

For example: It was a wooden table. 

In each sentence, the target word will have a particular, context-dependent meaning. Your task will be to rate how much you experience the concept that word refers to with six perceptual senses: hearing, sight, touch, internal bodily sensations, smell, and taste. Ratings will range from 0 (not at all experienced with that sense) to 5 (experienced greatly with that sense). Note that there are no right or wrong answers! In some cases, the word may not have any strong perceptual associations. In others, it may activate all of the perceptual senses very strongly.
